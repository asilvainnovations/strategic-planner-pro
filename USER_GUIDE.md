## Developing Strategic Options

Strategic Options are derived from your SWOT analysis using the TOWS Matrix approach.

### Four Types of Strategies

#### 1. SO Strategies (Strength-Opportunity)
**Use internal strengths to capitalize on external opportunities**

Example:
- Strength: "Strong R&D capabilities"
- Opportunity: "Growing green energy market"
- SO Strategy: "Develop innovative renewable energy solutions leveraging our R&D expertise"

#### 2. ST Strategies (Strength-Threat)
**Use internal strengths to mitigate external threats**

Example:
- Strength: "Strong customer relationships"
- Threat: "New competitors entering market"
- ST Strategy: "Launch customer loyalty program to defend market share"

#### 3. WO Strategies (Weakness-Opportunity)
**Address internal weaknesses to pursue external opportunities**

Example:
- Weakness: "Limited online presence"
- Opportunity: "Shift to e-commerce accelerating"
- WO Strategy: "Invest in digital transformation to capture online market"

#### 4. WT Strategies (Weakness-Threat)
**Minimize internal weaknesses and avoid external threats**

Example:
- Weakness: "High operational costs"
- Threat: "Price pressure from competitors"
- WT Strategy: "Implement lean processes to reduce costs and maintain competitiveness"

### Evaluating Strategic Options

For each option, rate:
- **Feasibility** (1-10): How realistic is implementation?
- **Impact** (1-10): What's the potential benefit?

Priority Matrix:
- High Impact + High Feasibility = **High Priority**
- High Impact + Low Feasibility = **Medium Priority** (requires planning)
- Low Impact + High Feasibility = **Quick Wins**
- Low Impact + Low Feasibility = **Low Priority**
